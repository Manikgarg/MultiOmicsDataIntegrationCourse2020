Overview

---

Results for TCGA cancer data

- Association with survival and clinical annotations
-- MCIA, JIVE, MOFA and RGCCA

- Association with biological annotations
-- MCIA and tICA

---

However for bechmarking

- Only continuous data was considered
- Same number of features were considered across all omics datasets
- Patients containing missing data were excluded

---

Aim

Benchmark MCIA, JIVE and MOFA on a dataset that account for these shortcomings.

---

Selected Dataset: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
