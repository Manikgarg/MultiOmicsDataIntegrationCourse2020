Aim

Benchmark MCIA, JIVE and MOFA on a dataset that account for these shortcomings.

Take-away

At the end of the course the participants will:

- get hands-on experience in using three different data-integration methods
- learn advantages and limitations of different methods
- get an intuition of which method to apply for which kind of dataset
- get hands-on experience with handling missing values
